# Validations Quiz

It's time to check your knowledge! Use this quiz to create a custom study guide.
Note any answers that were marked incorrect, so you can study the relevant
material and try this quiz again.  
If you don't know the answer to a question, please do not guess. Instead, select
"I don't know". It's OK not to know everything and to admit when we're unsure.

Check the [Active Record Validations
docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html) if you need
help!
