# Validations

Which of the following Active Record methods will trigger validations?

## Correct

`create`

> Right! Validations are triggered before most actions that save data to the
> database.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Correct

`save`

> Right! Validations are triggered before most actions that save data to the
> database.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Correct

`update`

> Right! Validations are triggered before most actions that save data to the
> database.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Correct

`valid?`

> Right! Even though calling `valid?` doesn't save any data to the database,
> it's a useful method to manually trigger validations.

## Incorrect

`new`

> Since `new` doesn't save any data to the database, it does not trigger
> validations. Validations are triggered before most actions that save data to
> the database, such as `create` and `save`.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Incorrect

`destroy`

> Since we use `destroy` with objects that are already saved to the database,
> there's no need to validate those objects before deleting them.

## Incorrect

`validates`

> `validates` is a class macro that is helpful for writing custom validation
> logic. It can't be called directly on an Active Record object, and doesn't
> trigger validation.

## Incorrect

`errors`

> The `errors` method returns a list of validation errors, but it doesn't
> trigger validation itself. Validations are triggered before most actions that
> save data to the database, such as `create` and `save`.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
