# Validations

At what point in time in a model's lifecycle do validations run? Select all that
apply.

## Correct

Before a new record is saved to the database

> Right! Validations are triggered before most actions that save data to the
> database.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Correct

Before an existing record in the database is updated

> Right! Validations are triggered before most actions that save data to the
> database.
> [This list](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#when-does-validation-happen-questionmark)
> shows other methods that trigger validations.

## Incorrect

Before a new instance of the model is created

> This one is tricky! It's possible to create a new instance of a model using
> Active Record without saving that record to the database immediately. For
> example:
>
> ```rb
> Dog.new(name: "Fezzik")
> # => creates a new dog instance
>
> Dog.save
> # => saves the dog to the database, triggering validation
> ```

## Incorrect

Before an existing record is deleted from the database

> Deleting a record from the database doesn't trigger validations; only creating
> or updating a record will cause the record to be validated.

## Incorrect

When an existing record is found in the database

> Looking up data in the database doesn't trigger validations; only creating or
> updating a record will cause the record to be validated.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
