# Validations

Which of these validations is most appropriate for making sure that a model's
**name** is not blank?

Check the [Active Record Validations docs][validations] if you need help!

## Correct

```rb
validates :name, presence: true
```

> Bingo! This method won't allow `name` to be `nil` when being created or
> updated. Check the [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :name, length: { minimum: 0 }
```

> Close, but this will actually still allow `name` to be created or updated with
> an empty string as a value. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :name, inclusion: 1..10
```

> `inclusion` is helpful for checking if a value is contained in a set of
> possible values. Check the [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more
> info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :name, acceptance: true
```

> `acceptance` is helpful for checking if a boolean value is true, like if a
> terms of service checkbox was checked by a user. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.
