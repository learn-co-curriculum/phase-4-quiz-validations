# Validations

Which of these validations is most appropriate for making sure that a
model's **category** must be either "Fruit" or "Vegetable"?

Check the [Active Record Validations docs][validations] if you need help!

## Correct

```rb
validates :category, inclusion: ["Fruit", "Vegetable"]
```

> Right! `inclusion` is helpful for checking if a value is contained in a set of
> possible values. Check the [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more
> info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :category, must_be: ["Fruit", "Vegetable"]
```

> `must_be` isn't a valid validation helper. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :category, one_of: ["Fruit", "Vegetable"]
```

> `one_of` isn't a valid validation helper. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :category, presence: { in: ["Fruit", "Vegetable"] }
```

> `presence` is useful for validating that an attribute is not blank, but it
> doesn't help check if an item is in a set of items. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.
