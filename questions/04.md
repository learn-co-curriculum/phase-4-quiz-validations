# Validations

Which of these validations is most appropriate for making sure that a
model's **title** is at least 20 letters long?

Check the [Active Record Validations docs][validations] if you need help!

## Correct

```rb
validates :title, length: { minimum: 20 }
```

> Right! `length` is helpful for checking the length of an attribute. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :title, at_least: 20
```

> `at_least` isn't a valid validation helper. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :title, minimum: 20
```

> `minimum` isn't a valid validation helper. Check the
> [Rails Guide on Validations][validations] for more info.

## Incorrect

```rb
validates :title, letters: { minimum: 20 }
```
