# Validations

Which of the following HTTP status codes should be returned from the controller
if a model's data is not valid?

## Correct

422 (Unprocessable Entity)

## Incorrect

418 (I'm a teapot)

> This is an actual status code that was created for an [April Fool's
> joke](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418) .

## Incorrect

500 (Internal Server Error)

> 500 Internal Server Error indicates that "something went wrong on the server",
> typically because of a runtime error on the server itself. You shouldn't return
> this status code from any controller actions directly; Rails will return this
> status code when your code encounters an error.

## Incorrect

404 (Not Found)

> This error indicates that the record itself wasn't found, not that the model's
> data was not valid.
