# Validations

Of the following HTTP status codes, which is the most appropriate to return from
the controller if a model's data is not valid?

## Correct

422 (Unprocessable Entity)

> Right! To quote the
> [spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918#section-11.2): The 422
> (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content
> type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct,
> but was unable to process the contained instructions. There are some
> [differences of opinions on this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20215807), but
> since Rails uses a 422 status code out of the box, this is a good convention
> to follow.

## Incorrect

418 (I'm a teapot)

> This is an actual status code that was created for an
> [April Fool's joke](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418)!

## Incorrect

500 (Internal Server Error)

> 500 Internal Server Error indicates that "something went wrong on the server",
> typically because of a runtime error on the server itself. You shouldn't
> return this status code from any controller actions directly; Rails will
> return this status code when your code encounters an error.

## Incorrect

404 (Not Found)

> This error indicates that the record itself wasn't found, not that the model's
> data was not valid.

## Incorrect
